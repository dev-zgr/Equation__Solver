# equation_solver
This project includes functions tools for solving 2nd degree equations.
Function included parsing, evaluating, validating, checking and solving.

sub functions package includes checker , initializer , evaluater extaractor and solver functions
main.py includes equity solver function that compounds all of these functions.

* Functions only solves functions respect to x using a ,b or c wont works.
* You should use superscripts like "x²,x³" while entering equations representation like x^2 didn't defined.
* you can break at most two whitespaces between charahcters equation like : "x² +4   x + 5" wont be solved.
* more complex parenthesized expression are still not supported function only works for simple "ax² + bx + c" functions.
